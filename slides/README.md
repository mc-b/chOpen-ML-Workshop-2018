Here you find the slides of the workshop, both as jupyter notebooks as exported html. It is recommended to look at the notebook files, as the html export is not very viewable. You need to have [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) installed to display the notebooks as proper slides (or simply use the provided docker image).
