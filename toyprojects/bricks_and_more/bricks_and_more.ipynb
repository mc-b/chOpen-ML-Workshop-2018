    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to do both Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning using the Keras API for Tensorflow. We will use a small, prepared dataset of Lego Technics parts. We will use the VGG16 model in this tutorial because its architecture is easy to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: It takes around 15 minutes to execute this Notebook on a laptop PC with a 2.6 GHz CPU and a GTX 1070 GPU. Running it on the CPU alone is estimated to take around 10 hours! With Google Colab GPU support, the training time is reduced to about 8 minutes per model."

    "## Flowchart\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to re-use a pre-trained model, in this case the VGG16 model, which consists of several convolutional layers (actually blocks of multiple convolutional layers), followed by some fully-connected / dense layers and then a softmax output layer for the classification. Well-written, brief explanations of VGG can be found in [this](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-VGG-neural-network) Quora post.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dense layers are responsible for combining features from the convolutional layers and this helps in the final classification. So when the VGG16 model is used on another dataset we may have to replace all the dense layers. In this case we add another dense-layer and a dropout-layer to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning is that in Transfer Learning we only optimize the weights of the new classification layers we have added, while we keep the weights of the original VGG16 model. This works well if our data is similar to the data the VGG16 model was originally trained with.\n",
    "In Fine-Tuning we optimize both the weights of the new classification layers we have added, as well as some or all of the layers from the VGG16 model. This works well if our data is somewhat different from the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, VGG16 has been trained on the ImageNet database which contains 1000 classes of common things such as balloon, strawberry, dog races and so on. In contrast, our Lego dataset consists of images of Lego bricks. Lower-level features of the trained VGG16 model such as edges and basic shapes can be reused for our dataset, as images of Lego bricks also consist of edges and basic shapes. However, higher-level features that are specific to the original dataset such as features that distinguish between cat and dog faces will be discarded. The layers deeper in the network represent these features and will be re-trained with our own Lego dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below depicts Fine-Tuning, while with Transfer Learning, the gray/yellow blocks would be larger and extend more towards the left."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial showed how to use the Keras API for TensorFlow to do both Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning of the pre-trained VGG16 model on a new dataset. It is much easier to implement this using the Keras API rather than directly in TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether Fine-Tuning improves the classification accuracy over just using Transfer Learning depends on the pre-trained model, the transfer-layer you choose, your dataset, and how you train the new model. You may experience improved performance from the fine-tuning, or you may experience worse performance if the fine-tuned model is overfitting your training-data."

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "These are a few suggestions for exercises that may help improve your skills with TensorFlow. It is important to get hands-on experience with TensorFlow in order to learn how to use it properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to backup this Notebook and the other files before making any changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try using other layers in the VGG16 model as the transfer layer. How does it affect the training and classification accuracy?\n",
    "* Change the new classification layers we added. Can you improve the classification accuracy by either increasing or decreasing the number of nodes in the fully-connected / dense layer?\n",
    "* What happens if you remove the Dropout-layer in the new classifier?\n",
    "* Change the learning-rates for both Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning.\n",
    "* Try fine-tuning on the whole VGG16 model instead of just the last few layers. How does it affect the classification accuracy on the training- and test-sets? Why?\n",
    "* Try doing the fine-tuning from the beginning so the new classification layers are trained from scratch along with all the convolutional layers of the VGG16 model. You may need to lower the learning-rate for the optimizer.\n",
    "* Add a few images from the test-set to the training-set. Does that improve performance?\n",
    "* Use another dataset.\n",
    "* Use another pre-trained model available from Keras.\n",
    "* Explain to a friend how the program works."
