This exercise is meant to be run on Google Colab. If you run it locally, you should have a GPU and a working CUDA installation, as models take several hours to train on a CPU.

How to use Google Colab for this exercise:

1. Browse to [https://colab.research.google.com/notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook)
1. Sign in to your Google Account (if not already signed in)
1. File -> Open Notebook... -> Github tab -> Search for `tobycheese`
1. Select the `chOpen-ML-Workshop-2018` repo (if not already selected)
1. Choose `toyprojects/bricks_and_more/bricks_and_more.ipynb`
1. File -> Save a copy in Drive
1. Runtime -> Change runtime type -> Make sure Python3 and GPU is selected
1. View -> Expand sections
1. Follow the tutorial and execute cells with shift-enter from top to bottom. If you don't want to do it interactively, choose Runtime -> Run all and save yourself some waiting time.
